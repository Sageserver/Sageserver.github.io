    <p style="float: left;"><center>During Westward Expansion in America, also known as Manifest Destiny, People needed an easier way to travel between east and west. Traditional wagon trains had proven to be a very risky and overall dangerous method of transportation. With industrialism growing and products needing to be shipped in order to make more money the Pacific Railroad Act was passed. This tasked the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroad companies with building a railroad that would connect the east coast to the west. This seemed to be an impossible task for the time. However it was completed making the Westward Expansion of America much safer and a lot easier.</center></p>
